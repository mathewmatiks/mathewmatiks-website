                    This was one of the assigments where we need to look into online debates, which was one of the first fundamental ideas
                    we needed to look at before proceeding to Writing Project 2. We had to look at an article that looks at the debate between
                    the meat eaters and vegans, and how they communicate with eachother.

                    This assigment allowed me to look at some of the ways we could make conducting research for Writing Project 2 by looking at
                    specific words to find results that would be grant benefitial information that could become a comment to analyze in the research paper.

                    This assigment focused on reading a research paper that looked at the correlation between lawyers and depression. This study was
                    done to answer a question of what causes lawyers to become burntout and feel a lot of stress. This was another good example 
                    of a structure towards conducting research, and I was able to make parallels between Model Analysis 1 and this article 
                    which has helped to find guidelines for writing a research paper.

                    After writing this assigment I looked back at Model Analysis 1 to make parallels and to figure out what are some of the key 
                    structural elements that are present in both research papers. I found it beneficial to do this as the two papers focused on different 
                    topics, but some elements were similar, like the showcase of a comment made by a person who is engaging in the topic and the analysis 
                    that followed the comment. I used this structure in Writing Project 2.

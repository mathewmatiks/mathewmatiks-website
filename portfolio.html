        <p id="text">My work primarily is driven by a story behind it, I want viewers to see an image and 
            start asking themselves questions, who is this, or why is it like that? I aspire to 
            create stories through video games, that leave people with some sort of emotion, it 
            can be happy, or sad, but that is exactly what makes games special. </p>

        is the primary focus.

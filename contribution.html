        Generating Inquiry

        Being able to generate and explore genuine 
        lines of inquiry related to writing, language, 
        literacy, and/or rhetoric.

        One of the quotes that I found interesting from the reading is a quote about the constraints involved 
        with each rhetorical situation. "Besides exigence and audience, every rhetorical situation contains a 
        set of constraints made up of persons, events, objects, and relations which are parts of the situation 
        because they have the power to constrain d√©cision and action needed to modify the exigence" I find that 
        a lot of rhetorical stations can always be broken down into different levels, it is always interesting to 
        look at the way people react differently in similar situations, it also opens doors to some philosophical 
        ideas. One of the things that I have heard and am wondering about is the behavior of people. A question could 
        be proposed whether we grow up and let events in our life shape us into who we are, or are we predetermined to 
        become what we are with the outside events not dictating us? A lot of times we may think that we are our own person,
         but in a world today it is easy to get lost in streams of other people's lives and forget yourself.

        There are multiple strategies a writer can employ to persuade their audience, this of course will vary depending 
        on the writing situation. I think books and speeches will require different approached from authors to persuade their 
        audience, they key is to understand who you are targeting, and look into ways the target audience can get persuaded.

        The author discusses rhetorical elements from the reading, and one thing that stood out to me is when they mention 
        the audience. The quote from the article "Chaim Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca point out that unlike speakers, 
        writers cannot be certain who their audiences are, and that rhetors often face "composite" audiences consisting either 
        of several factions or of individuals who each represent several different groups (214-17)." I find this interesting, 
        as whenever we prepare a piece of writing or anything that will include an audience, we must always guess who we are 
        writing or creating for, fine-tuning the piece to fit the interests of the audience to win them over.

        My question: Do you feel that the audience finds the reader, or does the reader find the audience?

        Hello Anthony.

    I think any message written to an audience if approached right, will always target them, and try to win them over, wether that 
    is emotionally, logically, or factually, the person writing should always look at the purpose of the message, and the audience 
    it is aimed at, that way it can prove to be more successful.

        One of the quotes that I found interesting from the reading is a quote about the constraints involved 
        with each rhetorical situation. "Besides exigence and audience, every rhetorical situation contains a 
        set of constraints made up of persons, events, objects, and relations which are parts of the situation 
        because they have the power to constrain d√©cision and action needed to modify the exigence" I find that 
        a lot of rhetorical stations can always be broken down into different levels, it is always interesting to 
        look at the way people react differently in similar situations, it also opens doors to some philosophical 
        ideas. One of the things that I have heard and am wondering about is the behavior of people. A question could 
        be proposed whether we grow up and let events in our life shape us into who we are, or are we predetermined to 
        become what we are with the outside events not dictating us? A lot of times we may think that we are our own person,
         but in a world today it is easy to get lost in streams of other people's lives and forget yourself.

                <p>
                    In this discussion we needed to think about ways we can put our work into a new medium. I have looked at Writing Project 2 for 
                    this assigment and have tried to think about what would be the best way to translate it into a new medium that will be more 
                    suited for its audience. I wrote about making a presentation and to make a case study out of it.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p>
                    I thought this assigment was a good start for Writing Project 3. It allowed us to create a plan and to work on top of it 
                    to push the idea of Writing Project 3.

                <h1>Sharing Our Methods and Research Questions</h1>

                <h2>Selection</h2>
            
                <p>
                    In this assigment we were required to look at some of the methods that we used for conducting research.
                    This assigment allowed to look at methods of other people, and analyze them to find some better ways 
                    of conducting research, and even critique my own way that I have improved after this assigment.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p>
                    I thought that this assigment was very beneficial, and it has helped me to look at the methods of other people
                    and to find new ways about adjusting the drafts for writing project 2.

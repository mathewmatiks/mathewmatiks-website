                    One of the first big projects of the semester was to create an Anotated Bibliography, which was later used as a foundation
                    for Writing Project 2. This assigment was critical into conducting academic research, whilst writing everything out in the
                    MLA format, which had later helped when writing the research paper.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p>
                    This assigment was very useful, as it created a foundation that has later allowed me to write Project 2 which was the research paper.
                    Althought I have chose a difficult topic, as not a lot of academic sources have been published on this 
                    as this is quite a recent technology. I thought this was a good assigment to start of the semester, and has later on helped to understand
                    the course structure where we were able to slowly work on top of the previous work, like with the drafts for Project 2

                <h1>Project 2: Research Paper</h1>

                <h2>Selection</h2>
            
                <p>
                    The assigment Writing Project 2 is where we needed to use our conducted research to look into a community
                    to answer the question we proposed in the Annotated Bibliography. I wrote the paper on the topic of ChatGPT
                    and how it affects the IT industry. I have found the research very interesting. One key element that stood out 
                    to me was a person writing a comment on hom ChatGPT has affected his corse in Python, and his proposed solutions
                    to the problem that he has faced.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p>
                    I thought that this assigment has been one of the most critical in developing writing skills. I have never written a 
                    research paper before, and this has allowed me to further push my skills in taking in research information, and to connect
                    it to real world situation.

                <p>
                    The QQC 1 Assignment allowed me to start utilizing rhetorical elements and start making connections to the reading,
                    I looked into the behavioral situations of different people in a given situation which created a good foundations for
                    looking into real world situations.

                <p>
                    I think this assigment allowed me to start looking at multi-modual writing. That it doesn't just include something written on paper, but can
                    also span into different mediums, which can better target an audience.

                <h1>Assigment QQC 2</h1>

                <h2>Selection</h2>
            
                <p>
                    This Aiggment opened doors to heavily look into the ethics behind not just communication of poeple,
                    but also the issue of documenting this reasonably. I found this assignment interesting as a person that is from a foreign country,
                    I find a lot of issue discussed here not as heavily relevant or minor, the article I was responding to allowed me to look into the 
                    issue more deeply, and understand the concerns behind it, which has made my writing more mindful of issues like this, and what would
                    be the way to approach them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This assignment has also shown a way of placing comments, and online messages into a research paper, the formatting and the best way
                    to structure a paper. Which have translated into my Writing Project 2 when we made a research paper.

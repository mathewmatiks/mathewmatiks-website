                <p>
                    I chose Writing Project 3 which showcased how I have transferred the information that 
                    I gathered for Writing Project 2. I conveyed it into a new medium, as a powerpoint. I talked about
                    ChatGPT and how it started to affect the IT industry, which is a topic that is interesting to me.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p>
                    I though this project was successful, that it showed that information can not just be confined to one medium,
                    and it has allowed me to look at written work in a different way.

                <h1>Everything is a Remix Video</h1>

                <h2>Selection</h2>
            
                <p>
                    I chose the assigment where we got the chance to watch a video on what is a remix. I thought that it was very
                    interesting and allowed me to look at the concept of remixing. That it can happen in different mediums like music,
                    movies, and art. This has introduced the difference between copying someones work, and using it to create something neww.
                    Another interesting part is how Led Zeppeling has copied a lot of music, and the impact it had.
                </p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>

                <p>
                    This assigment allowed me to get to the idea of creating a powerpoint presentation to inroduce the concept of a research
                    paper into a new medium. I though that it was not only sufficient to watch the video, but the handout has allowed me to rewatch 
                    the video and get more out of it, which was also used in Project 4.

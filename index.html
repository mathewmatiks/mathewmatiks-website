    <p>I am currently a student at UCF studying Game Design. I see games as a medium for storytelling, 
        I often compare them to books and movies. Books have the ability to allow you to create the visual 
        aspect of the story in your head, while movies are the opposite, they already tell you the visual story, 
        and you are left wondering why a character has made the decisions that he had. Video Games are a combination 
        of movies and books, they tell you the story visually, and they add a character story which can create a 
        greater emotional response from the player.</p>

    <p>My work primarily is driven by a story behind it, I want viewers to see an image and 
        start asking themselves questions, who is this, or why is it like that? I aspire to 
        create stories through video games, that leave people with some sort of emotion, it 
        can be happy, or sad, but that is exactly what makes games special. </p>

        <h1>ChatGPT and how it affects IT Industry.</h1>

    <h1>The issue at hand.</h1>

    <p>
        The IT Industry has seen a shift after the introduction of ChatGPT, which makes writing basic code accessible to everyone, 
        and can impact those already working as a programmer, as it poses a risk of being able to already write bad code within seconds,
        making basic level programming even less valuable as a skill. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The case study focuses on a person who created a Python course to be learned by people who are new to programming, and want 
        to learn how to use the language Python to write basic scripts. With ChatGPT there has been a change with students approach 
        making the course aim, which is to teach students to understand code irrelevant.  
    </p>

    <p>
        The course creator, Phillip, wrote a program that teaches people to write basic Python Code for Data Analysis. The issue came 
        when all users posted very similar, or exact code for an assignment, leading to the conclusion that it was plagiarised. The 
        first thought to combat it was to make the students mark our exactly where ChatGPT was used to write code, and provide a statement 
        showcasing an understanding of the code being written. 
    </p>
   
    <p>
        The issue was solved by providing outline of an understanding of code, and outlining what ChatGPT wrote, however this scheme went against 
        the learning outcomes of the course, as it aimed at teaching people to write simple code for their needs, but now it resulted in people 
        learning to use ChatGPT to write simple code.
    </p>

    <h1>Solution Proposed</h1>

    <p>
        The solution that was proposed, was to understand and accept the reality of the shift of today's world, and adapt the courses 
        which will accommodate technology used today. Rather than focusing on a very singular path of education, which is present 
        in almost all institutions, to create a framework that accommodates work created for projects, which encapsulate many minor 
        assignments that go into a single large one. However this creates an issue, if you are an entry level person that has little 
        understanding this will have to be explained by a person with a higher level, and for that you will need a lot more resources 
        than are available. 
    </p>

    <h1>What this taught us and how we can combat it</h1>

    <p>
        The case has shown us that ChatGPT creates a bridge towards reaching higher level programming but that creates an issue which 
        will hinder further progress, as there would be no basic understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
        The possible solution as proposed, would be to change the way education is organized, which focuses on minor projects which 
        will bring together a single large one, which goes against the design of education in Russia, where at the end of your degree 
        you need to write a diploma consisting of everything you have learnt. It may make sense in certain fields, however in programming, 
        it would be much more successful showcasing a large projects instead of a piece of paper.

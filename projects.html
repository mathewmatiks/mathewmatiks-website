    <h1>PROJECTS</h1>

    <p>My work primarily is driven by a story behind it, I want viewers to see an image and 
        start asking themselves questions, who is this, or why is it like that? I aspire to 
        create stories through video games, that leave people with some sort of emotion, it 
        can be happy, or sad, but that is exactly what makes games special. </p>

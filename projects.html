    <h1>Soviet Artists' Way of Speaking Out</h1>

    <div class="container">

    <p>Art has been known to fascinate the viewers eye for thousands of years. Ever since the early 
    Neanderthals started painting animals in caves, to us mixing pigments with oil and applying it to surfaces, to now
    using computers to draw. Art has evolved, there is no doubdt about it, and primarily we see the way it is moving today,
    but what about the other parts of art. Those that decided not to follow in steps, and decided to branch out of the stream
    and create their own culture. Russia is one the best examples of this.</p>

    <p>Art was a very sensitive topic in the Soviet Union, it was very difficult to be a prominent artist, and especially
    difficult to speak your mind about certain topics, as most likely that would lead you to being captured, and working 
    in labour camps. So people turned to the street. An anonimous message, hidden in a mosaic that shows the beaty of communism,
    right in the middle of the city. It portrays three figures, a soldier, a factory worker, and a person in a space suit, but below
    them we see a sickle, and instead of a hammer there is a wrentch, which might not seems like a big deal, until you start noticing that
    the wrentch appears more like a bone, and now you start asking questions.</p>

    <p>Art in Russia is a difficult subject. Those who follow the "Guidelines" are praised, funded, and put on the podium. Those that break laws
        work on creating a different standart in art, make it more accesible, much more controversial, much more beautiful are shunned and put down.
        So the artists who dont follow the Guidelines look at the streets, and what they could give them, and what they provide, is a clear, and a blank
        canvas open to creativity, and freedom.
